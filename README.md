# Gameshop Pro
Designed for both game store customers and game store owners, Gameshop Pro allows customers and store owners to work together to manage orders, check-ins, loyalty programs and more.
 
## User Personas
### Dave - Indiscriminate Whale
Dave is a whale. That is, Dave spends a lot of money in the gaming hobby, but he doesn't really care about where he spends his money. Dave buys 
a wide variety of things, more than the average shop stocks, so being able to special order things for him is very important. Plus, Dave hates 
to see product that he's ordered sitting on the shelf in another store, so a store needs to get him product quickly and let him know whenever 
there's an issue.

Dave is not that concerned about deals, nor loyalty programs, but he does like to be able to look back on all the stores he's visited.
 
### Jessica - Loyal Whale
Jessica, like Dave, spends a lot of money in gaming stores. However, she likes to shop at one store and is more patient than Dave. But, Jessica 
is a bit scatterbrained so she really needs a good way of tracking her special orders.

Jessica also doesn't care that much about loyalty programs.

### Sarah - Focused Buyer
Sarah, unlike a whale, only buys things that she beliebes she'll actually use. She can't really be bothered to order things - either the store has it or they 
don't. She does like to save money, so a decent discount program is cool for her. 

### Mike - Deal Hunter
Mike loves games but his disposable income is pretty limited. He only really buys things that he can get at a discount. He also rarely pre-orders things
because he wants to make sure he likes the game before he buys.
