## User Personas
### Dave - Indiscriminate Whale ... (ed1bc51e-22c9-452f-b0b0-993b4c7be10e)
Dave is a whale. That is, Dave spends a lot of money in the gaming hobby, but he doesn't really care about where he spends his money. Dave buys 
a wide variety of things, more than the average shop stocks, so being able to special order things for him is very important. Plus, Dave hates 
to see product that he's ordered sitting on the shelf in another store, so a store needs to get him product quickly and let him know whenever 
there's an issue.

Dave is not that concerned about deals, nor loyalty programs, but he does like to be able to look back on all the stores he's visited.
 
### Jessica - Loyal Whale
Jessica, like Dave, spends a lot of money in gaming stores. However, she likes to shop at one store and is more patient than Dave. But, Jessica 
is a bit scatterbrained so she really needs a good way of tracking her special orders.

Jessica also doesn't care that much about loyalty programs.

### Sarah - Focused Buyer
Sarah, unlike a whale, only buys things that she beliebes she'll actually use. She can't really be bothered to order things - either the store has it or they 
don't. She does like to save money, so a decent discount program is cool for her. 

### Mike - Deal Hunter
Mike loves games but his disposable income is pretty limited. He only really buys things that he can get at a discount. He also rarely pre-orders things
because he wants to make sure he likes the game before he buys.

## Store Personas
### Dark Legion Games ... (7b213b3e-9fef-484d-92e2-255b7790ea8c)
DLG is a small suburban store that focuses on selling board games with some RPGs and a line of popular miniatures. The owner/proprieter, Mary, runs the shop by 
herself with the occasional help from trusted customers. Mary has a digital point of sale system and uses it to track her sales and run the discount program for 
her customers. She doesn't have the personnel or technology to track customers much more than that and uses an old notebook to track special orders. This has 
caused her to miss a few things, but her customers are loyal and understanding. Currently, her marketing is limited to social media. Finally, due to her small size,
she doesn't get a very good dicount from her distributors and needs to keep everything as tight as possible.

### Pyramid Gaming ... (b54329b7-1d7a-4f1d-a830-5f3209951d39)
Pyramid is ran by two brothers, Mike and Jay. The store has been around for a long time and has built up a loyal customer base and carries both RPGs and board 
games. Their miniature selection is limited to a few really popular lines. They buy used games but need to find a way to price and move items quickly. While 
they don't run a diiscount program, they are known to give people a break when spending a big dollar amount. Marketing is limited to sporadic emails and social 
media blasts. Special orders are tracked with Excel spreadsheets. They have good relations with all of their distributors and are often able to get products 
that are more difficult for other stores to get.

### Stuffed Games
Stuffed Games is a large outfit. They sell not only multiple lines of RPGs, board games, and miniatures but also airbrush supplies, casting supplies and
other accessories. They have multiple employees, a large gaming area, and a devoted customer base. Due to their large volume, they get good discounts and 
preferential treatment from their distributors. Their success, however, is also part of their issue: they get a LOT of special orders and have difficulty 
tracking it all. Like most other gaming stores, they only use social media for marketing but their most important asset is word of mouth.

### Big Daddy Games
BDG represents a new trend in gaming stores: combination game store and cafe. The owner, Nora, has fully embraced technology. Most game stores do sell online, 
but BDG makes it the primary thrust of their business. The cafe mainly serves as a way to let people try out games and get the word out. Nora offers a fairly 
convoluted discount program based on purchases in a calendar month, discounts on games they've tried out, and referring new customers.

### Store Needs

- Use special/pre-order data to determine order levels.
- Use sales trends to track par levels.
- Flash sales and newsletters.
